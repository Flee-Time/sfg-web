It was clean, it was basically a digital resume.</p>\n<h2>My problem</h2>\n<p>It was <em>too</em> static. </p>\n<p>I listed projects there out of obligation, but I found that I felt like a project needed to be <strong>finished</strong> or <strong>perfected</strong> before I could even think about putting it on the site.</p>\n<p>That meant a lot of the stuff I coded or built never saw the light of day. And because I wasn&#39;t publishing anything, I kept jumping from project to project without ever wrapping things up.</p>\n<h2>The Fix</h2>\n<p>It started when I began keeping notes in <strong>Obsidian</strong>. I went &quot;wow, markdown is actually really cool&quot; and I got the urge to document my &#39;experiences&#39; properly. </p>\n<p>This site is the result of that idea. I just drop a Markdown file in a folder, and it turns into a web page. A clean, distraction free wall of text and sometimes images.</p>\n<p>Whether it&#39;s a full project or just some boring coding stuff, the goal is to be more responsible. I expect that by forcing myself to document the process, I&#39;ll actually stay on track and finish more builds.</p>\n<p>There is so much stuff I’ve never shared with the world, abandoned prototypes, niche scripts, and hardware hacks that would make people squirm.</p>\n<p>And hey, if a post here helps someone else fix a really specific bug down the line? Hell yeah.</p>\n",
