Welcome to **sfg-web**.

If you knew me before, you might remember my old site. It was clean, it was basically a digital resume.

## My problem
It was *too* static. 

I listed projects there out of obligation, but I found that I felt like a project needed to be **finished** or **perfected** before I could even think about putting it on the site.

That meant a lot of the stuff I coded or built never saw the light of day. And because I wasn't publishing anything, I kept jumping from project to project without ever wrapping things up.

## The Fix
It started when I began keeping notes in **Obsidian**. I went "wow, markdown is actually really cool" and I got the urge to document my 'experiences' properly. 

This site is the result of that idea. I just drop a Markdown file in a folder, and it turns into a web page. A clean, distraction free wall of text and sometimes images.

Whether it's a full project or just some boring coding stuff, the goal is to be more responsible. I expect that by forcing myself to document the process, I'll actually stay on track and finish more builds.

There is so much stuff I’ve never shared with the world, abandoned prototypes, niche scripts, and hardware hacks that would make people squirm.

And hey, if a post here helps someone else fix a really specific bug down the line? Hell yeah.
