Welcome. This is the home for my projects, notes, and technical writing.

I use this space to keep track of what I’m learning in the worlds of Linux, hardware, and embedded systems. If I’ve spent three hours debugging a weird kernel issue or wiring up a prototype, I’ll probably write about it here so you don’t have to.

**Not a Resume:** This site is a living document of my process. You’ll find experiments that didn't work, notes that are still being refined, and plenty of "learning out loud."
